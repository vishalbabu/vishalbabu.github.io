I have a multitude of experience in a wide range of fields. I have great hardware design and testing experience with my time at Tesla Motors and Nuvation Engineering. I design and implemented robust test procedures and wrote my own custom software to validate components. I have worked at Apple Inc in a supply chain role where I designed unique EOL(end of line) test protocols to lower the fail rate in production. At Blackberry I worked with radio communication design, specifically how the phone transfers data between itself and the cell network. I have worked on many personal projects using SOCâ€™s like Arduinos and Raspberry Pies. Through my wide variety of experiences I have had the opportunity to apply unconventional solutions to very unique and pressing problems. I have been able to adapt to very different situations given my different experiences and have been able to learn new things at an incredibly fast rate.
