  <h2 align="center">Automated Shopping Cart</h2>
  
  <p>During our first term of Systems Design Engineering, four other students and I worked together to develop an improved retail solution. The issue we saw was the amount of time that is wasted by people in grocery stores. They must travel around filling their carts, queue up and wait for a cashier, unload their cart, scan their items, reload their cart, and then travel to their car and unload their cart once again. This was an obviously inefficient system, so we decided to improve it. We followed the engineering design process from problem definition and idea generation all the way to prototyping and evaluation. </p>
