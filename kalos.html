  <p>Kalos is an IOT solution to a growing problem of spinal injuries in the weight room. Training while maintaining form is the only way to get the most out of an exercise and any compromise in that form will detract from the goal of working out. Many users were surveyed and consulted about this issue and using this feedback requirements were set. From these requirements the initial design was wrought and tested. Upon further improvement, Kalos tracks not only the uses form but also the reps and performance statistics of the exercise. Kalos consists of a pressure plate that measures the force distribution of the user and an IMU to track their form. Both these data sets combined feedback to the user on the quality of their workout.
